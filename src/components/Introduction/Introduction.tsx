        This is Huy Le, I’m a Fullstack Web Developer with 2 years of experience
        building modern web applications. <br /> <br /> I specialize in
        JavaScript and TypeScript, working across both frontend and backend.
        <br /> <br />
        On the frontend, I have experience with React, Next.js, Remix, and
        TanStack, along with strong foundations in HTML and CSS to build
        responsive and user-friendly interfaces. <br /> <br />
        On the backend, I work with Node.js, Express, and NestJS to develop
        scalable APIs and server-side applications. I enjoy building clean,
        efficient, and maintainable applications, and I’m always looking to
        improve my skills and stay up to date with modern web technologies.
